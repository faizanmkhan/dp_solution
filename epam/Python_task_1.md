# Programming Tasks

## Task 1 — `loop.py`

Calculate `n!`.  
`n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * … * (n-1) * n`, `0! = 1`. `n >= 0`.

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
3
```
Output:
```
6
```

**Example 2:**

Input:
```
5
```
Output:
```
120
```

## Task 2 — `digits.py`

Find sum of `n`-integer digits. `n >= 0`.

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
321
```
Output:
```
6
```

---

## Task 3 — `strings.py`

Check whether the input string is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

Input:
```
abcba
```
Output:
```
yes
```

**Example 2:**

Input:
```
test
```
Output:
```
no
```

## Task 4 — `lists.py`

Consider a list (`list = []`). You can perform the following commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `insert i e` | Insert integer `e` at position `i`. |
| `print` | Print the list. |
| `remove e` | Delete the first occurrence of integer `e`. |
| `append e` | Insert integer `e` at the end of the list. |
| `sort` | Sort the list. |
| `pop` | Pop the last element from the list. |
| `reverse` | Reverse the list. |

Initialize your list and read in the value followed by lines of commands where each command will be of the types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.

The first line contains an integer denoting the number of commands. Each subsequent line contains one of the commands described above.

**Example:**

Input:
```
12
insert 0 5
insert 1 10
insert 0 6
print
remove 6
append 9
append 1
sort
print
pop
reverse
print
```
Output:
```
[6, 5, 10]
[1, 5, 9, 10]
[9, 5, 1]
```

> ⚠️ **Don't convert the list to a string for output!**
> ```python
> l = [1, 2, 3]
> print(l)      # correct
> print(str(l)) # wrong
> ```

## Task 5 — `dicts.py`

Drop empty (`null`) items from a dictionary.

**Example:**

Input: *(note: double quotes must be used)*
```
{"c1": "Red", "c2": "Green", "c3": null}
```
Output:
```
{'c1': 'Red', 'c2': 'Green'}
```

---

## Task 6 — `sets.py`

Find common items in 2 lists without duplicates. Sort the result list before output.

**Example:**

Input:
```
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
```
Output:
```
[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
```

---

## Task 7 — `split_join.py` *(add by yourself)*

Given a string, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

Each word is separated by a single space and there will be no extra spaces in the string.

**Example:**

Input:
```
Let's take LeetCode contest
```
Output:
```
s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc
```
